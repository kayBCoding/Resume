                <li>Java: My understanding of Java pairs with a brief stint in SQL while learning about databases.</li>
                <li>SOQL and SOSL: As these are not actual langauges but bases in Salesforce, howveer extensive knowledge was gained within both.</li>
                <li>OOP</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>My first project consisted of something most of us love, ice cream! I wanted to incorporate my love for this frozen treat into the concepts I was learning within Salesforce so I created a virtual storefront called Kustom Kreations</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kustom Kreations: A storefront that takes custom ice cream and treat orders as well as delviery orders. Whatever you can imagine Kustom can create.</li>
            </ul>
